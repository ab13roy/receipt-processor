## üèÉ Running Using IntelliJ
1. Download IntelliJ from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download" target="_blank">here</a>.

## üê≥ Running Using Docker
- To run the project using Docker. You need only one thing. That is Docker Desktop on your system
- Download Docker Desktop  from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/" target="_blank">here</a>.
- You do not need IntelliJ or JDK or Gradle to run, if you are using the docker image.


### Steps to Create the Docker Image
- Navigate to the project directory and build the image:
```shell
docker build -t receipt-processor .
```
- Verify that the image has been created:
```shell
docker images
```
- Run the container with:
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 receipt-processor
```
#### *With this the project should be up and running at port 'http://localhost:8080'*

## üõ¢Ô∏è Navigating H2 Database
- This application makes use of in memory H2 Database.
- Once the application is running, the database console can be accessed through the browser.
- H2 Database console 'http://localhost:8080/h2-console'
- Username and password for login can be found at

### Accessing when running the application using IntelliJ
- When running using IntelliJ. You can log in directly using the username and password from the [properties file](/src/main/resources/application.properties).
### Accessing when running the application using Docker
- When running using docker image. Update the JDBC url at the login screen. JDBC url can be found at [properties file](/src/main/resources/application.properties).We need to do this because the H2 is currently running in a docker container and we are remotely trying to access it.

## üìö Accessing Swagger Doc
- Once the application is running. Regardless the way you chose to the run the application. Swagger Doc can only be accessed at 'http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/'
